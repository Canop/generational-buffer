Unless you're only fixing some typo or propose a trivial change, please note those rules:

- an issue should generally be created first to discuss the need
- be aware that I may not want a change that I'll have to maintain
- keep it simple and focused 
- don't touch more files or lines than necessary
- apply the standard formatting of the project
- check tests
